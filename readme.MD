In this lab, I used Unix tools to simplify looking at a protein Database file named 4HKD.pdb. For the first question, I used grep commands to list records which do not include the words: ATOM, HETATM, TER, and END. In the next question, I used a sed commands to replaces instances of HETATM with ATOM and MSE with MET. For the third question, I wrote an awk script called minmax.awk which calculates the minimum and maximum values from fields 7-9 of ATOM records. For the fourth question, I wrote an awk command to find the average of the 7-9th fields. In the fifth question, I used a sed command to change instances of HOH with WAT. For the last question, I wrote a sort command combined with grep to numerically order the 11th field for ATOM records. In the next portion of the lab, I wrote a shell script to convert the string form such as 1/3/4 into an absolute number of knuts. I wrote another awk program to convert the number of knuts into it's original string form. These shell scripts are named numConvertString.sh and stringConvertKnuts.sh. In the last question, I created a shell script with commands to sum the absolute number of knuts and the sum of the individual fields in the string file.
